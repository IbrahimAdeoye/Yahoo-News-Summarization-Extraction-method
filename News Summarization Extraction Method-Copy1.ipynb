      "[{'Mom Called for Jury Duty Has No Babysitter — So She Shows Up with 1-Year-Old Triplets in Tow (Exclusive)': \"Torrey Scow didn't want to face the $1000 fine for skipping jury duty, so she packed up her four kids for what ended up being an adventure Torrey Scow Instagram Torrey Scow is used to getting looks as she goes about her daily life with four kids — triplets Lexi, Zoey and Lincoln, 18 months, and daughter Emory, 5 — but when she shared her experience at jury duty, others really took notice. In June, the mom of four was called to jury duty and thought a lack of child care would allow her to reschedule. I even sent them a picture because I wanted them to know how hard it is for me to find a babysitter, because the only person I have that can handle all four kids is either myself or my husband, or my mom, Torrey tells PEOPLE of the incident. It'd be easier if they were older toddlers, but they're still babies who need bottles and changing at different times. But they ended up sending me a random day around three days out from the day I got it.

Related: Mom Goes Viral After Sharing Son&#39;s Honest Birthday Invitation — and Says Come with No Expectations With husband Kory at work and her only babysitter out of town, Torrey submitted to having to do it on her own. I told my husband, 'Don't worry about it. I bet if I just take them, they'll probably see me and send me right home. It'll be fine.' The day of jury duty, Torrey recalls she didn't even put shoes on them because I just thought, 'We're not going to be there long.'  To her surprise, Torrey was kept there. I walked into this room and it's just dead silent. There are all these adults there by themselves and one other mom with twins, but they were older] and well-behaved. Torrey relied on her arsenal of snacks to try to keep the toddlers busy. I think they ate more snacks than they ever had in their lives at that point because it was the only thing that was keeping them quiet, she says. After a while, the snacks stopped working as the antsy little ones wanted to roam. They start screaming, but they're in this stage where they scream at the top of their lungs. It's not possible to get one baby quiet, let alone three. And my older daughter is so good, just sitting there and trying to help as they throw their bottles on the floor and everyone's looking at us. When Emory needed a bathroom break, Torrey took the kids to stroll around in the hall until they were taken in to see the judge. Thinking again that she'd soon be dismissed, Torrey was held longer. I thought for sure the judge would see me and excuse me, but he started going through so many questions. And I couldn't even hear them because my babies are so loud and other people in the room are asking him to repeat questions. As the judge spoke, Torrey was running relay after the triplets as they wandered around the room until one of the officers took her to a closed-off hall space just outside, where they could roam as she tried to listen.He was so nice and found them this box of toys, stuffed animals and whatnot, and brought them in for them to play with. And finally, once they were getting entertained and settled, the judge said he was going to release who he didn't need and let me and one other person go home. While she was relieved, the mom of four was baffled that she was kept there for two and a half hours. Usually it's me and my husband when we go out with all the kids, but this time it was just me and I was physically and emotionally exhausted when it was all done. It was me by myself and it's dead silent and all eyes are on me. I was so close to crying by the end and then they finally let us go. Admitting she's been met with her fair share of very nice people and those who stare, Torrey says that as a mom of multiples, she's used to being stopped. The most common comment she hears? I don't know how you do it. And it's really the third [baby that makes it feel hard, because you only have two arms and anytime I'm taking them anywhere, I have to carry two and go back for one. We have to have everything super baby-proofed. Courtesy of Torrey Scow Still, she wouldn't have it any other way. After being told she couldn't carry due to the effects of an autoimmune disease medication, Torrey and Kory welcomed Emory via surrogate — her sister-in-law. A change in medications allowed her to carry the triplets on her own, though she was told it was unlikely she'd end up with multiples at all. So we did have one set of embryos that were two embryos that were frozen together. And if you have two that are frozen together, they suggest you keep them that way, she explains. If you're trying to separate them and it doesn't work, then you just have to discard both, so you do have a slightly higher chance if you put in two of getting one to stick. And that was our plan, to hopefully get one out of it. Torrey Scow Instagram Choosing to go without IVF drugs this time around, when she got her bloodwork done, the results made the couple feel confident they'd have twins. We go in for the ultrasound, the very first ultrasound, and the tech goes to the embryos and we instantly see they both stuck, she recalls, saying her husband was definitely stressed by the news. I joked, 'At least it's not triplets' and we all laugh, including the doctor, and as she's measuring both embryos she moves to the side and stops. And she looks up at me and says, 'Oh no.'  Thinking she'd lost one of the babies, instead the tech showed her that one of the embryos had split. You are having triplets, the couple heard. I wish I had a camera because it was so dramatic. I luckily was laying down or else I probably would have passed out, but I tried to keep my cool in the room and I was just asking questions while I hear Kory taking deep breaths and the nurse telling him it's going to be okay. Once they left, Torrey cried as she confronted the fears of what was to come. I wanted a kid so bad, but when you find out it's three and there's only two of us, it's like, 'How are we supposed to do it?' Plus, it was my first pregnancy ever and I have this medical condition and now this pregnancy is high risk. I bawled my eyes out. The two braved 32 weeks of pregnancy with the triplets, which included pre-eclampsia that led to her induction. And while the ordeal was scary, the mom of four says, It is all so worth it. You're going to have rough moments, but if you even have one child or no children, you have rough moments. But the good times, you get time three, and it is the absolute best. Try to put away all those worries and be positive. I think that's the biggest thing is just stay positive. It all works out, she shares as a word of advice to other multiple moms and dads. It can be so stressful but it's so worth it for three times the laughs, three times the smiles, three times the cuddles. For more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!

I want to make it clear that my brother and I are safe and alive, but I’m completely heartbroken, and struggling to even find the right words to say,” she told the outlet. It’s been a very traumatizing 24 hours. All day yesterday, I was bombarded with endless heartbreaking and tearful phone calls from loved ones all while trying to sort out this mess.” The bizarre hoax began when a statement was posted on Lil Tay’s Instagram on Wednesday, purportedly from her family, announcing that both Tay and her brother had died. We have no words to express the unbearable loss and indescribable pain,” the post said. This outcome was entirely unexpected, and has left us all in shock.” ‘Really F*cking Confused’: Lil Tay’s Inner Circle Casts Further Doubt on Her Death However, the rapper and social media star claimed to TMZ on Thursday that her Instagram account was hacked. She claimed Meta helped her regain access to her account, and the original post has since vanished. My Instagram account was compromised by a 3rd party and used to spread jarring misinformation and rumors regarding me, to the point that even my name was wrong,” she said. My legal name is Tay Tian, not ‘Claire Hope’.” From the jump, the circumstances surrounding Tay’s death” were fishy. The police department in Vancouver—where Tay was believed to be living as of 2021—confirmed several times to The Daily Beast that it had no record of the deaths of Tay or her brother. Sources close to her, including her dad, ex-managers, and family friends, were also unable to confirm her death and were skittish when it came to providing details. But who would have hacked a niche, underage influencer who hasn’t been in the public eye in five years? With a cast of colorful characters surrounding Tay—including a former manager now hawking cryptocurrency in her name, and an allegedly abusive mother, father and brother—many on social media have speculated that the hack” was an inside job. The new cryptocurrency Liltay Token” is run by none other than Tay’s ex-manager Harry Tsang. He had initially told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that, after speaking to people close to the family, he cannot definitively confirm or dismiss the legitimacy” of the death announcement. Tsang has been quiet since Tay revealed she’s alive. Meanwhile, Tay’s social media manager Duane Laventure, who initially declined to comment on Tay’s apparent death under instruction from Tay’s mom, simply told The Daily Beast on Thursday afternoon, I’m not a spokesperson.” Producer and close family friend John Cunningham had commented on Wednesday’s death announcement, telling Tay’s mom to call me please I’m on my way to the house.” But when reached by The Daily Beast on Thursday morning, shortly before Tay seemingly re-emerged to say she was alive, he claimed to be just as in-the-dark as most of the internet. I don’t know man. I’m really fucking confused,” he said, adding that he only answered The Daily Beast’s call in hopes that it would have some information for me.” In a video about the situation posted to TikTok on Wednesday, Tsang referenced his personal psychic,” Eliza, who told The Daily Beast the following about Tay’s death announcement: I pick up something not very real about the statement.” Turns out Psychic Eliza was right.

Images of climbers clambering past the injured Pakistani on a treacherous ridge on the same day that Norway’s Kristin Harila ascended have been condemned by fellow mountaineers. They claimed a Western climber would not have been left to die and said the scenes would be unthinkable in the Alps, igniting a row about how local Sherpas are used in the Himalayas. Harila, 37, climbed Pakistan’s K2 on July 27, securing her 14th highest peak in just over three months to become the world’s fastest climber to scale all peaks above 8,000 metres. During her ascent, porter Mohammed Hassan fell off a sheer edge at the top of the area known as the bottleneck, some 8,200 metres high. Ms Harila said her team did everything they could to save Mr Hassan, but conditions were too dangerous to move him. However, two climbers who were also on K2 that day claimed fellow mountaineers were more interested in setting records than saving lives, in an apparent dig at Harila. Wilhelm Steindl and Philip Flämig, an Austrian climbing duo, say drone footage they later recorded hours after Harila and her team had passed the ridge showed climbers walking over his body instead of trying to rescue him. It’s all there in the drone footage,” Mr Flämig told Austria’s Standard newspaper. He is being treated by one person while everyone else is pushing towards the summit. The fact is that there was no organised rescue operation although there were Sherpas and mountain guides on site who could have taken action.” Among those who passed him was Ms Harila. Such a thing would be unthinkable in the Alps. He was treated like a second-class human being,” Mr Steindl added. If he had been a Westerner, he would have been rescued immediately. No one felt responsible for him,” he said. What happened there is a disgrace. A living human was left lying so that records could be set,” he said. Ms Harila defended her actions on Thursday, saying that her team did everything they could to save Mr Hassan. It is simply not true to say that we did nothing to help him. We tried to lift him back up for an hour and a half and my cameraman stayed on for another hour to look after him. At no point was he left alone,” she told the Telegraph. Given the conditions, it is hard to see how he could have been saved. He fell on what is probably the most dangerous part of the mountain where the chances of carrying someone off were limited by the narrow trail and poor snow conditions,” she said. She also denied that Mr Hassan would have been treated any differently if he were a Western climber. We did all we could for him,” she said. Reports by several climbers have raised questions about the standard of equipment that Mr Hassan had been provided with before he set off up the mountain ahead of the western climbers, who often pay thousands of dollars for a guided ascent. Ms Harila said when her team found Mr Hassan he was not wearing either gloves or a down jacket and didn’t appear to have been given oxygen. If he were my Sherpa I wouldn’t have sent him up in that condition,” she said. According to Mr Steindl, who visited the porter’s family after descending the mountain, Mr Hassan took the perilous job of rope fixer in order to pay for his diabetic mother’s medical bills, even though he lacked the experience to perform the job. His family cannot afford medicine or food. Ms Harila and many of the climbers flew over us and the family in helicopters. What a symbolic image. The helicopter to fly out costs up to $12,000 per person,” he said. Thaneswar Gurugai, the general manager of Seven Summits which organised Harila’s trek, told the Telegraph that Hassan was suffering from frostbite and hyperthermia when he died. In normal cases other porters would save them unless it is quite impossible to do.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

In June, the mom of four was called to jury duty and thought a lack of child care would allow her to reschedule. I even sent them a picture because I wanted them to know how hard it is for me to find a babysitter, because the only person I have that can handle all four kids is either myself or my husband, or my mom, Torrey tells PEOPLE of the incident. It'd be easier if they were older toddlers, but they're still babies who need bottles and changing at different times. But they ended up sending me a random day around three days out from the day I got it.

Related: Mom Goes Viral After Sharing Son&#39;s Honest Birthday Invitation — and Says Come with No Expectations With husband Kory at work and her only babysitter out of town, Torrey submitted to having to do it on her own. I told my husband, 'Don't worry about it. I bet if I just take them, they'll probably see me and send me right home. It'll be fine.' The day of jury duty, Torrey recalls she didn't even put shoes on them because I just thought, 'We're not going to be there long.' To her surprise, Torrey was kept there. I walked into this room and it's just dead silent. There are all these adults there by themselves and one other mom with twins, but they were older] and well-behaved. Torrey relied on her arsenal of snacks to try to keep the toddlers busy. I think they ate more snacks than they ever had in their lives at that point because it was the only thing that was keeping them quiet, she says. After a while, the snacks stopped working as the antsy little ones wanted to roam. They start screaming, but they're in this stage where they scream at the top of their lungs.

      "{'Why it won’t just be up to the James family whether Bronny plays for USC — or any other school': \"The death of Hank Gathers has made universities more cautious in clearing athletes to play through a heart condition. Nine years ago, Chai Baker awoke to a bewildering scene. The Oregon State basketball player had no idea why he was in a hospital bed, a tube down his throat, a monitor tracking his vital signs and loved ones by his side. It was terrifying,” Baker said. I didn’t know what happened. I didn’t even know where I was or how long I’d been there.” Baker soon learned that he’d collapsed two days earlier during a workout at Oregon State’s practice facility. At first, teammates noticed him gasping for air in the layup line. Moments later, athletic trainer Tom Fregoso was scrambling to administer CPR and shock Baker’s heart back into rhythm after the 19-year-old crumpled to the court and began convulsing. The cause of Baker’s cardiac arrest turned out to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a hereditary heart condition that Baker had never heard of before. He initially didn’t grasp the severity when his physician told him that it causes the heart muscle to thicken and stiffen abnormally, impeding blood flow and increasing the risk of arrhythmias. By the time Baker returned to campus after a week in the hospital, he had made up his mind not to let his diagnosis stand in the way of his dreams. He felt fit and strong again. He had no chest pain or other symptoms. He was eager to implant a defibrillator in his chest so that he could return to playing basketball as quickly as possible. Baker says he would’ve risked playing for Oregon State had the university not intervened and taken the decision away from him. Oregon State director of sports medicine Douglas Aukerman informed Baker in early November 2014 that the threat of another cardiac incident was too severe, that Baker could remain on scholarship but he couldn’t play again for the Beavers. When they didn’t clear me to play, it kind of crushed me,” Baker said. It was very, very hard. I still felt physically like I could play. I didn’t understand the severity of my situation and I didn’t take it well.” Baker’s story hints at what may be ahead for Bronny James as he undergoes testing to determine the cause of his cardiac arrest on July 24 and evaluates whether to keep pursuing basketball. It isn’t only up to LeBron James' eldest son and his family how much risk of a cardiac arrest recurrence they can tolerate. USC will also have to assess if the threat is too much to clear the highly touted incoming freshman to play for the Trojans. A USC spokesperson declined comment when Yahoo Sports asked for an explanation of how the university decides whether to clear an athlete with a newly diagnosed heart condition. Cardiologists who have been involved in these decisions say that universities typically evaluate anything from the athlete’s risk of cardiac arrest, to the threat of a lawsuit or barrage of negative publicity if something went wrong. With college sports, there are lots of stakeholders that have an interest in the athlete playing but also not wanting to take on additional liability,” said Lili A. Barouch, director of sports cardiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. It’s tough. It’s not always a straightforward decision.” The Hank Gathers impact It’s easy to pinpoint when schools started becoming more cautious about the risk of allowing athletes to play through a heart condition. It was the day that a supremely talented prospect with so much life in front of him stumbled, collapsed and never got up again. Hank Gathers often declared himself to be the strongest man alive, but the Loyola Marymount forward wasn’t as invincible as his muscular physique and charismatic personality suggested. He had a heart condition that caused him to faint during a December 1989 game against UC Santa Barbara and to suffer fatal cardiac arrest three months later after a soaring alley-oop dunk against Portland. The aftermath of the tragedy devolved into a deluge of malpractice and negligence allegations against the school, the doctors who treated Gathers and even his coach. Beverly Hills attorney Bruce Fagel filed a $32.5 million lawsuit on behalf of the Gathers family that ultimately netted a $545,000 settlement. Gathers’ death lingered in the national headlines long after the LMU men’s basketball team finished honoring its fallen star with an emotional Elite Eight run. Decades later, his story still casts a shadow over a struggling basketball program that has not won a conference title since 1990 nor returned to the NCAA tournament. That high-profile incident and another involving Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis inspired research into whether these deaths were anomalies.\"}\n",

It’s taken me a while to get to the place to have the confidence and the vulnerability to sit down and have this conversation with you guys,” Hill said in the teary-eyed video. But I want to talk to you about what’s been going on in my personal life and behind the scenes of the camera that has led to me making the decision — on my own — to shut down both Jaclyn Roxanne Jewelry and my Koze comfort line.” Hill, whose real name is Jaclyn Torrey, first became known in 2011 after launching a beauty channel on YouTube. Her videos quickly became so popular that, over the next 12 years, Hill grew her audience to more than 5.5 million subscribers, plus nearly 10 million followers on Instagram and TikTok. Along the way, she launched multiple beauty and lifestyle-related brands; but her rise to fame didn’t come without some drama. Hill has been mired in multiple controversies over the years — including her most infamous one in 2019 when customers claimed that a lipstick from her newly launched makeup brand, Jaclyn Cosmetics, arrived broken, lumpy and even dirty. At the time, Hill apologized to anyone dissatisfied with the product but insisted there was nothing wrong with her lipsticks. My lipsticks are not moldy. They are not hazardous. They are not contaminated. They are not unsafe for you in any way, shape or form,” said Hill. Every single ingredient in my lipstick is new and is FDA-approved.” Still, not everyone was happy with how she handled things. According to WWD, Hill momentarily deleted her social media accounts, and the Jaclyn Cosmetics website was even briefly taken down after the brand initially promised full refunds to any customer who wanted one.'}\n",

      "{'NHL outliers: Players who like to fight, hit or keep their noses clean': \"The NHL is full of players whose physicality is a key part of their identity, as well as guys who avoid contact whenever possible. This series will shine a light on the most unusual NHL players — the guys who stand out from their peers in one way or another. Part 3 looks at the most and least physical players in the league. Previous articles: Size and Nationality — There is an absolutely massive range in physicality among NHL players as some make their living by throwing their body around and others see hard contact as an obstacle rather than a goal. Although the game has become more and more dominated by skill in recent years, there are still plenty of guys who earn their salaries by making life painful and difficult for opponents, while leaving the scoring to others. The players highlighted below either embrace the physical aspect of the sport more than any of their peers, or opt to rarely — if ever — engage with it. The most prolific hitter: Michael Pezzetta, LW, Montreal Canadiens Laying out opponents is Pezzetta's calling card, as he offers limited offensive value and has an average ice time of 8:39 in his brief NHL career. Over the last two seasons, the 25-year-old has delivered 24.01 hits per 60 minutes — significantly more than the man who ranks second by that metric (Ryan Reaves at 20.13). The winger has never had much of a role beyond tone-setting in his professional career. He's produced 26 points in 114 NHL games and 25 points in 115 AHL games. Even in the OHL, he managed just 0.46 points per game. Listed at 6-foot-1, 210 pounds, Pezzetta isn't a massive wrecking ball of a human being, but he has a knack for making his presence felt. Michael Pezzetta with the HUGE hit and then casually tosses the gloves to meet Austin Watson  pic.twitter.com/YeoZohF5NQ — B/R Open Ice (@BR_OpenIce) February 26, 2023 It's difficult to quantify the utility of a guy like Pezzetta, but clearly the Canadiens think he's an asset as Montreal signed him to a two-year extension in June. The least prolific hitter: Johnny Gaudreau, LW, Columbus Blue Jackets  It makes sense that a 5-foot-9 offensive winger listed at 165 pounds wouldn't be among the NHL's top hitters, but Gaudreau's total avoidance of hitting sets him apart. The 29-year-old delivered just five hits in 2022-23 despite playing in 80 games and skating 19:25 per night.\"}\n",

In Washington, D.C., where Trump faces charges of conspiring to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election, District Judge Tanya Chutkan — a Barack Obama appointee — is running the show. In Florida, where Trump has been indicted for hoarding classified documents, District Judge Aileen Cannon — a Trump appointee — is at the helm. Guess which judge the defendant prefers. I’m very proud to have appointed her,” Trump gushed about Cannon last month. She’s very smart and very strong, and loves our country. We need judges that love our country so they do the right thing.” As for Chutkan, Trump has been more … critical. There is no way I can get a fair trial with the judge ‘assigned’ to the … case,” he posted Sunday on Truth Social. Everybody knows this, and so does she! We will be immediately asking for a recusal of this judge on very powerful grounds.” Even though experts say Trump’s demand that she be recused is meritless — and his own lawyers have signaled that they agree — the former president and his allies are certain to keep pleading his case in the court of public opinion. (Chutkan will rule Thursday on special counsel Jack Smith’s request for a protective order to prevent Trump from publicly targeting individuals.”) Politics aside, which judge is actually more likely to preside fairly, that is, by neither opposing nor favoring Trump?

      "{'Fantasy Football Mock Draft: 10-team dynasty startup': \"It's fantasy football mock draft season, and things are no different here at Yahoo Sports. Our team recently conducted a 10-team, dynasty startup fantasy football mock (with half-point-per-reception scoring), and all the picks are in the cool graphic up top. Scroll to the right of the graphic above to see the complete results of the draft. For those unfamiliar with dynasty formats, it's a league where you retain your roster season-to-season compared to a redraft league where rosters reset every year. A dynasty league is also different from a keeper league, where you're limited in the number of players you can retain. Our partners at 4for4 have a more in-depth look at dynasty leagues. More mock drafts: 10-team half-PPR | 12-team full-PPR] Don’t be a massive ageist. Please. I’m begging you to not be solely youth-focused when you head into these exercises. This particularly applies to the early rounds. Take, for example, a guy like Davante Adams in this exercise. He went in the bottom of Round 3 behind multiple wide receivers who, while I like their games quite a bit, don’t have a prayer of being as good as Adams over the next two seasons — or ever, for that matter. You could argue even I’m guilty of this type of ageism by taking Brandon Aiyuk one pick ahead of Cooper Kupp in Round 4. I know there are some dynasty folks who will read this and laugh at the idea of the next two years,” as if that’s all that matters. I’ll just say that windows are never as long as you think and the exercise of a dynasty rebuild is no lock to work out. Look, building dynasty rosters is a matter of personal preference — subjective player evaluation comes into the mix along with differing goal-based timelines and varying opinions about positional value. So, honestly, maybe don’t even take anything I’m writing in this recap seriously. It’s your team. Who cares what anyone has to say? Me included. [Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today] Personally, I’m not trying to play dynasty fantasy football like it’s some pseudo-stock market or pretending internet player values” or rankings mean anything at all to individual league managers. I am just both trying to win the league every season and keep players on my team whom I think are good at football. That requires a balanced roster of promising youth and high-caliber players who may perhaps be rounding toward the back nine of their careers. As for you and your house, do as you please. Running backs crash the party I’ve been in some dynasty drafts where wide receiver is placed at a tremendous premium. That was not necessarily the case in this draft. Five running backs went in the first eight picks. Bijan Robinson landing third overall isn’t out of the ordinary. He’s an excellent prospect entering the league, already a clear Round 1 fantasy selection in redraft. So this sort of dynasty value makes sense. Even a guy like Christian McCaffrey, while a mild surprise as high as fourth overall, is such a rare producer that I can understand taking the plunge in Round 1. The other backs took me by surprise just a bit simply because we know the longevity concerns at the position. Round 2, on the other hand, saw just three RB selections as drafters turned their eyes to receivers. Ironically, all three drafters that took running backs at Pick 6, 7 and 8 in Round 1 ended up with a wide receiver I’d straight-up rather roster in dynasty. So I guess that worked out. The most interesting back in Round 2 is Breece Hall right at the top. I understand he’s currently dealing with an injury but I’d guess that if Hall has an awesome stretch run or back half of 2023, he’ll be a first-round startup selection in 2024 given his age and explosive ability. If you don’t break the QB dam early, just wait Speaking as one of the folks who helped break the quarterback dam in Round 3, I’m perfectly happy with making the major swing for Josh Allen even in a 1QB league. I won’t think about that position again for many years other than churning the QB2 spot, which I didn't even bother to address in this draft considering some of the names on the waiver wire. In total, three quarterbacks — Allen, Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes — went off the board in Round 3 with Joe Burrow not far behind in Round 4. Four more quarterbacks went off the board in Rounds 5 and 6. While I like some of those swings, especially Anthony Richardson in Round 6, I do worry some of these quarterbacks aren’t going to be enough of individual difference-makers over the long-term in a start-one quarterback format. They’ll have their moments, certainly, but remember we need to start three wide receivers and a flex in this league. Value over replacement and opportunity cost matter just as much in a dynasty startup as they do in your seasonal leagues. I ended up liking the approach of a drafter like Dan Titus who waited until the double-digit rounds and took multiple bites of the apple with upside swings mixed in. That’s a viable strategy in this format. Wide receiver is just so deep We get to rounds 8, 9 and 10 and it’s tough for me to find a receiver pick I do not like. You can get veterans with strong near-term windows in this range like Mike Williams, Christian Kirk and Tyler Lockett. You can take big swings on talented second- and third-year guys like George Pickens, Rashod Bateman and Elijah Moore who all have a shot to rocket up startup boards next year with a few breaks in 2023. You can also just make your Tier 3 rookie bets in this range like Jalin Hyatt, Rashee Rice and Jonathan Mingo (my favorite pick here). Definitely stack your team early with high-caliber WR1 candidates. But don’t forget to start rounding out at receiver as it gets later. Some second- and third-year running backs went late If you’re going receiver early and taking the plunge on an elite quarterback in a startup you’re sacrificing at running back. That was my approach. The good news is that there are multiple Year 2 and 3 running backs who could hold down the top spot on their team’s depth chart for a few seasons, at least. We know this position is hyper fragile and even highly drafted or very good players can be usurped at any moment. That applies to the guys like Rhamondre Stevenson, Dameon Pierce, Travis Etienne and Najee Harris. But again, if we’re just thinking in those near-term windows, those guys can help keep your team strong for now as your wide receiver corps does the heavy lifting. You just have to plan to do some tinkering on an annual basis with your backfield. The dynasty TE landscape is even weirder than redraft Just one tight end came off the board in Round 3 and of course, it was Travis Kelce. The Chiefs tight end will turn 34 this season but the position is in such a state of flux, even the most youth-focused, fake stock-broker dynasty player couldn’t form a credible argument to hate that pick. We then saw three tight ends get picked in Rounds 4 and 5, and then another three between Rounds 7 and 9. Moral of the story: we don’t even know what to do with this position long-term. Never once did it ever feel like this draft was about to experience a tight end run as we witnessed at other positions. The tier breaks at tight end are difficult to project and the gap between said tiers is massive. [Overall Top 300 | QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | DEFs | Ks Jahan Dotson is likely the most underrated dynasty WR Jahan Dotson is a very good football player. He was a completely underrated prospect who even outkicked my lofty expectations with his ability to beat press coverage as a pure outside receiver. It wasn’t that Dotson went super late here. He came off the board in Round 6 (shockingly, to my team). When looking at the 2022 drafted receivers, Dotson is much closer to Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson and Drake London as a talent than he is to Christian Watson, Treylon Burks and George Pickens. Dotson is a crisp and refined route runner — but that’s not all he is; people who think that are just profiling him based on size. Dotson showed in Year 1 he’s just as capable of making explosive plays in the vertical passing game and winning contested passes as some of these bigger receivers folks like more. Too many people who play fantasy football are still wide receiver size-ists. Take advantage of them. The QB situation still isn’t clean and he’s paired with a true alpha, top-10 real-life receiver in Terry McLaurin but everything about Dotson as an individual player is screaming upward trajectory. I think too many dynasty players didn’t really watch him as a rookie and are still holding onto pre-draft priors. Here are the team-by-team results of the mock draft in order of selection. Team 1: Andy Behrens, Yahoo Fantasy Analyst Player Overall pick Player Age 1. (1) Justin Jefferson (Min - WR) 24 2. (20) Nick Chubb (Cle - RB) 27 3. (21) Jalen Hurts (Phi - QB) 25 4.

Fantasy analyst Antonio Losada highlights some 2023 projections he thinks are too high. QB Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars — Yahoo Projection: 331.66 points Trevor Lawrence kicked off his professional career in 2021 to much fanfare and as hyped as you could imagine after wrapping up his college days early. He wasn't even a remotely great fantasy player in his rookie season (he nearly missed the top-25 QB list that year) but last season was an entirely different story for the then-sophomore Jaguar. Entering 2023, Yahoo projects T-Law to throw passes for a few hundred more yards than he did last year, to break the 30+ touchdown barrier, and to finish with 330+ fantasy points for an average of around 19+ FP per game next season. Sorry, but I just can't see such a jump happening this early in his career. Lawrence will play his age-24 season in 2023. He should be years away from reaching his absolute prime. Even then, he's already put up gaudy numbers so there might not be much room to grow in Jacksonville for him. The sophomore QB threw the seventh-most passes last year (nearly 600 already), accrued the ninth-most passing yards and boosted his fantasy value with the fifth-best and 10th-best marks on rushing touchdowns (five) and yards (291). We were told Lawrence was going to be a generational player, so hey, perhaps he can put up Yahoo's projections. That said, the platform is expecting Lawrence to do something only the other 11 quarterbacks have done before him (baseline of 4,400+ passing yards, 30+ TDs, and 25+ rushing yards). In the last five years only Joe Burrow, Josh Allen, Justin Herbert and Patrick Mahomes reached those benchmarks in their third pro-seasons or earlier. However, Lawrence will need to reach those numbers with Calvin Ridley as his WR1, who's coming off spending more than a year on the shelf. Not trusting this projection just one bit. QB Russell Wilson, Denver Broncos — Yahoo Projection: 301.42 points The Denver Broncos started a new era last season when they decided to trade their house away for the right of calling Russell Wilson one of their own. Denver decided to make another bold move this summer, the second in as many years, by hiring former Super Bowl champion HC, Sean Payton. Will the Broncos' offense suffer a sudden improvement and rise as a whole on their way to fixing their 2022 wrongs? Allow me to think that won't happen — at least, not to the extent Yahoo is projecting it. Wilson is coming off the worst season he's ever played in the NFL. He posted his worst marks on total fantasy points, FP per game and FP per snap. Wilson threw his fewest touchdowns ever (16), the second-most interceptions through his career (11) and completed a measly 60.5% of his 292 pass attempts, another career-low. The Broncos' offense, barren of truly talented weapons, didn't help. It won't help this year, either, as Denver has already lost WRs Tim Patrick and KJ Hamler for the season and will need to ease RB1 Javonte Williams in as he's coming off an ACL injury. While the change of head coach might turn into a volume boost on the passing front, I'm not buying the overall improvement of this offense and therefore I think Wilson will fail to deliver for the second season in a row.\"}\n",

      "{'Fantasy Football Mock Draft: 12-team full-PPR': \"It's fantasy football mock draft season, and things are no different here at Yahoo Sports. Our team recently conducted a 12-team, full-point-per-reception fantasy football mock, and all the picks are in the cool graphic up top. Scroll to the right of the graphic above to see the complete results of the draft. Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today Team-by-team results are at the bottom of the article — but first, some interesting findings about the draft's results from our very own Dalton Del Don. Check out our 10-team half-PPR mock draft here. Injuries and holdouts made an impact • Jonathan Taylor’s ADP has been dropping given his uncertain situation, but he suffered no dip in this mock. Aside from his contract situation (and assuming his back is fine as he says), Taylor has questions regarding targets and raw rookie Anthony Richardson taking over at QB. But he’s also one season removed from totaling 2,200+ yards with 20 touchdowns and could be legitimately the best back in football. Richardson should also open the field for Taylor, so it’s hard to argue with the pick. That said, given that mobile quarterbacks typically don’t throw as much to their running backs, Taylor can be downgraded a bit in PPR formats. • Breece Hall fell nearly a full round past his Yahoo ADP, likely due to the Dalvin Cook-to-the-Jets rumors swirling during this draft (Hall’s fantasy value should be boosted in PPR). Cook left New York without a deal, and his eventual landing spot remains a mystery. Cook could be better this season after finally undergoing shoulder surgery, but he’d need to improve dramatically to keep a healthy Hall off the field. Hall’s fantasy managers may require a little patience either way, but he’s likely to be a top-five fantasy player over the second half and is my favorite to be the consensus No. 1 overall pick in 2024. • I rank Ja’Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson incredibly close but still went Chase despite Joe Burrow’s injury scare. Given how much time there is before the season, I’m treating Burrow’s calf injury as if he’ll be good to go Week 1 (as long as he doesn't listen to Chase's advice). I give Chase the ever so slight edge given his touchdown advantage — Chase has just three fewer TD catches in 21 fewer games than JJ and played injured last season — and being tied to Burrow, but most drafters disagree. WR is a huge priority in PPR • As expected in a PPR format, this draft resulted in more wide receivers (18 of the first 34 picks) being drafted early compared to our previous 0.5 PPR mock (14 of the first 35 picks were WRs). While the aggressive drafting left few sleeper receivers available later, Rashee Rice was an exception (says the person who drafted him). Quarterbacks, on the other hand, aren't • Quarterbacks dropped in this draft compared to the previous 10-teamer, which makes sense given the format differences. Wide receiver becomes a bigger priority in a 12-team PPR league. Jalen Hurts and Josh Allen were both steals in round three, while Lamar Jackson and Justin Fields were also strong picks in round four (the QB tier then suffers a big drop thanks to the rushing-upside discrepancy). That said, it’s also perfectly fine to wait until much later to address quarterback in leagues that start just one, highlighted in this draft by Tua Tagovailoa going at the end of round nine. Tagovailoa got 8.9 (!) YPA last season, when he threw as many touchdowns as Tom Brady in 333 fewer attempts. • I have Daniel Jones as a top-10 fantasy QB this year (with top-five potential), but he was an afterthought in this draft. Brock Purdy is in the world’s best system and led all QBs in fantasy points per dropback last season — and wasn’t even drafted here. There are multiple strategies to attack QB in 2023 (and they can vary greatly depending on format), so waiting on the position certainly remains viable. Some undervalued picks to highlight • Drake London has a top-36 ADP on other PPR sites, so he looks like a steal at pick No. 57 here. London had a historically good rookie season, will no longer have Marcus Mariota throwing to him and has the weakest WR2 competition in the league. London is the real deal, and Atlanta is likely to pass more in 2023. Questions remain regarding Desmond Ridder, but London gets to play indoors for a Falcons team that projects to have an incredibly favorable schedule. The Drake is good! • Courtland Sutton already looked like a good value in the 10th round of a PPR draft, but he looks like a great one now that Tim Patrick and KJ Hamler are out indefinitely (the Patrick injury news had just barely broken when we drafted). Sutton was a fantasy bust in 2022, but don’t forget he was being drafted ahead of Jerry Jeudy at this time last year, and Denver’s offense was a dysfunctional mess. With targets now opening (Jeudy has had trouble staying healthy as well), and Javonte Williams unlikely to be himself (he’ll be wearing a knee brace) right away, Sutton is suddenly looking at a real opportunity. He’s still just 27 and is another year removed from his knee surgery. The Sean Payton factor shouldn’t be underestimated, as the Broncos are about to undergo a dramatic upgrade in coaching not unlike what Jacksonville experienced last season. Russell Wilson has worked hard during the offseason after last year’s disastrous performance (and Jarrett Stidham is a more than capable alternative if Payton prefers him). Sutton was extremely undervalued being selected as the WR48 in this draft. Here are the team-by-team results of the mock draft in order of selection.

      "{'NFL betting: Which rookie quarterback is worth backing this season?': 'The NFL is all about the quarterback. Selecting one early in the draft is one of the most significant moves a franchise can make. It marks a starting point of a new era, and puts a face to its vision of the future. The front office, coaching staff, players and fans are all ready to turn the page on the previous challenging season and embrace a new direction. In today’s NFL, they usually don’t have to wait very long to see their quarterback in action. There will always be exceptions like Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers or Jordan Love. But for the vast majority of these guys, the luxury of learning on the sidelines is not an option. That appears to be the case with this year’s class. Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Anthony Richardson each could realistically be under center when the season opens. Wagering on win totals isn’t always just about combing over the schedule, grading offseason moves and applying your projections. It can be beneficial to target situations that surface year after year, and see if the historical data can provide a small edge. That can be new head coaches, quarterbacks with new playcallers or rookies playing against NFL defenses for the first time. Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today Clevanalytics had some interesting data on the success of teams that relied on first-round quarterbacks (for at least nine starts) in their rookie season. Since 2014, only 36% of teams went over their preseason win total. Going back to 2002, only 26.8% have won more than 50% of the games they started in Year 1. These are both based on small sample sizes, and the results are a combination of the massive jump from college and the lofty expectations from bettors for these players. How will this season’s rookie quarterbacks fare?'}\n",
      "{'2023 Fantasy Football Draft Day Blueprint: The guide you need to succeed': \"Last season on Yahoo, 87.1% of teams that started 5-0 made their fantasy playoffs. Among 4-1 starters, 71.8% of teams made the dance. Once you got to 3-2, it could go either way; 50% of teams made the playoffs. Anything below .500 and the odds were stacked against you. Fantasy football season is nearly upon us. In a matter of weeks, millions of people will draft their teams and begin the pursuit of fantasy glory. But if we’re being real, millions of folks have already done just that. For me, football is my year-round obsession. Not a day goes by that I don’t consider the sport and the potential range of outcomes for the upcoming season. I think about this 365 days so you don’t have to. I’m obsessed, so you get to enjoy your normal life. And I’m far from cursed in mine, to be fair.

So let’s delay no further, it's time to unveil the blueprint to build your most successful season yet. Good luck! Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today Big picture thoughts for the 2023 season The more I have thought about fantasy football this year, the more I’m convinced it all starts at quarterback. How you approach the quarterback decides the rest of your team. No pressure. I was all-in on going early quarterback this year. I’ve said it many times on the Yahoo Fantasy Football Show: all my good teams last season featured either Jalen Hurts or Josh Allen. I am a full believer that elite QBs are back in the mix for early draft consideration because players like that are both incredibly efficient passers and offer rushing upside to break that game. The ceiling and floor combination is tough to beat. But pieces like Andy Behrens’ Is waiting at QB still a winning strategy?” and conversations like the one I had on the podcast recently with Dalton Del Don have me wavering. There are some very appealing quarterbacks who go late in drafts. And same as it ever was, the opportunity cost of taking an early quarterback remains. I want to make sure I have at least one anchor running back who comes from the first two rounds of drafts. I want a strong three-wide receiver corps that is filled with alpha target hogs or clear 1B receivers on a great offense. I loved the way Scott Pianowski said it on a recent podcast: Get three receivers who start themselves.” All of that is hard to pull off if you also want to lock in someone from the first tier of quarterbacks. Do I pass on that elite tier and try to hunt for rushing-based breakout candidates like Anthony Richardson or Daniel Jones? When you hit on one of those guys and they actually emerge as a fringe top-five scorer and your early running back and receiver picks work out, you build an unfair roster. And yet, Andy’s words from his quarterback piece stick with me: In recent years, however, we've witnessed a string of the most remarkable individual quarterback campaigns in league history; golden-ticket seasons for fantasy purposes. Patrick Mahomes set the all-time QB fantasy scoring record in 2018. Lamar Jackson set the per-game scoring record the following year. Mahomes, Jalen Hurts and Josh Allen each produced seasons in 2022 that rank among the top-12 historically on a per-game basis. Mahomes now has the No. 1 and No. 2 QB scoring campaigns on his resume. Twelve of the top 18 all-time fantasy seasons at this position were delivered over the past five years.” Those seasons were legendary and that’s why all of those players — yes, including Jackson — make up my first tier. I am fully convinced all of those players can have seasons like that again in 2023. And I don’t mind paying for the certainty. I haven’t fully decided just which side of this internal debate I’ll land on being best for the season. Frankly, since I believe both are viable, it gives me the flexibility to live in the moment and let each individual draft come to me. I’d advise you to do the same. Best fantasy ecosystems (drink) If you know me, I am all about ecosystems. Fantasy football can be all about hammering players from the best ecosystems in the NFL. I always think back to the Peyton Manning Broncos teams circa 2013. Sometimes winning your fantasy league is as simple as hoarding as many players from those kinds of special offenses. It’s obvious that great ecosystems equate to some of the most potent and efficient offenses in the NFL. They’re surrounded by a quality line, loaded with good skill position talent and stewarded by a high-end play-caller. But there’s more to it than that. In fantasy, it’s important we look at these highly concentrated offenses around the league. The 2022 Eagles were the best example of this. They had three star-caliber skill-position players and that’s where they threw the ball. If they were dropping back to pass, the ball was going to A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith or Dallas Goedert. Those guys combined for over 80% of the team targets. They didn’t mess around with a pass-catching back, a third receiver or a red-zone menace tight end. If they kept it on the ground, they were breaking the math and hammering people in the run game with Miles Sanders or Jalen Hurts. It made them painfully hard to defend but quite easy to predict in fantasy. The Jacksonville Jaguars could be this year’s Eagles; an efficient offense with a concentrated target tree. You can confidently draft Calvin Ridley, Christian Kirk and Evan Engram because they’ll be drawing the vast majority of looks. The 49ers have a setup like that with their top four guys and the Seahawks' receiver set should handle the bulk of the targets. You can be in on all three of DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and Jaxson Smith-Njigba in fantasy this season. I am, because Geno Smith’s performance was legitimate in every sense of the word. Those are my four favorite ecosystems to target in 2023. Every year, I write about the teams we need to get right in fantasy football. The 2023 edition included the Browns, Chargers and Colts. With a few breaks, any or all of those three teams could jump into the elite ecosystem tier. You can call them the cautiously optimistic honorable mentions. Fast Start vs. Hot Finish Whether analysts know it or want to admit it, best-ball brain has seeped into all of our content. The popularity and fun of Best Ball (available on Yahoo) have made it hard to transition the way we talk about that game into traditional redraft leagues. There is a difference, though. With many looking to take down massive best-ball contests, we’ve gotten overly obsessed with the end of the season. You’ll hear folks say Weeks 15, 16, 17 … the ones that matter most for fantasy football,” when analyzing individual player or team outlooks. That’s true in a sense, even for redraft-managed teams. Those are the fantasy playoffs and we all want to win those weeks to take the league championship. We know why they’re a focus but, you have to get there in the first place for them to matter at all. And that’s where I’m changing my tune a bit. I have always been fine with drafting my teams with a flippant attitude to the start of the season to leave myself open to late-season upside. I’m usually all about the hot finish. No one has caused me to reevaluate that stance more than Scott Pianowski. He's banged the drum about the benefits of starting fast for years and has pushed fantasy managers to draft to win September.” The numbers are on his side. Life is just a lot easier if you’re riding hot coming into mid-October. You can start filling your bench with late-season upside stashes like your favorite rookie receiver or a high-end backup running back when you don’t have to worry about chasing needs on waivers. You can get the best of both worlds with that hot start.\"}\n",

The bottom line? Consumers may be buying more cars. For the month of July, consumer prices for new autos were down 0.1% compared to June and up 3.5% year over year, with the yearly figure coming down considerably compared to the prior month’s 4.1%. The used car market saw even more moderation, with prices down 1.3% for the month of July alone, and dropping 5.6% year over year. Car prices, in particular for used vehicles, seem to be coming down faster compared to inflation in the broader economy, which saw overall CPI rise 3.2% in July year over year.

Here's what to know about prices for beef, chicken, eggs, fruit, and sweets. Grocery prices had been cooling, then came July. The cost of food at home — what consumers see at their local supermarkets such as Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), and others — increased slightly in July after remaining mostly flat in recent months. Grocery prices increased by 0.3% on a monthly basis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) released Thursday. On a year-over-year basis, food-at-home inflation rose 3.6%, a slower rate than the month prior. Overall, consumer prices were up by 3.2% in July over the prior year and 0.2% month over month. The beef and veal category, which rose 2.4%, was one of the biggest drivers of the month-over-month increase. The category saw the largest jump since September 2021, BLS economist Steve Reed told Yahoo Finance. Uncooked beef roasts led that monthly jump with a 6.5% increase from June to July. Beef steaks were up 2.3%, while other cuts of beef and veal were up 3.6%. What's behind the jump? According to Wells Fargo agricultural economist Michael Swanson, higher beef prices stem from the aftermath of one of the worst droughts we've had in the Southwest last year and a sell-off of all the cattle. Essentially when a drought happens, producers sell off cows at once, which makes beef cheap. Now, as ranchers rebuild their herds, higher feed prices are costing them more and driving up prices overall.\"}\n",
      "{'The best hair growth products of 2023': \"Hair loss impacts millions of people in the U.S., and not just aesthetically; it's linked to a greater risk of developing stress and depression. To add insult to injury, hair loss is complicated, and the right solution requires understanding the underlying cause of the thinning and loss. The most common cause of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, aka male pattern hair loss or female pattern hair loss, explains Dr. Amy Forman Taub, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant professor at Northwestern University Medical School. The second most common is called telogen effluvium and can be caused by many things, including severe stress, childbirth, certain drugs and thyroid abnormalities, Taub says. Thankfully, in most cases, hair thinning and loss can be treated and reversed with great success. Given that millions suffer from hair thinning and hair loss, the market is beyond saturated with lotions and potions promising miracles. Choosing the wrong product means wasting money, as well as time that could be spent on the right solution for you. To help you better understand what's going on with your distressed tresses, we consulted with multiple dermatologists and hair loss specialists for their input on what works and what doesn't, and what to specifically look for in hair growth products to give you the best chance of success. We also made sure to include a range of products at various price points to help meet you where you're at, so you can get started on the road to recovery as soon as possible. Before we dive into the best hair regrowth treatments, there are a few factors to consider before shopping for the best hair growth product for you. Key considerations The best hair growth product for you ultimately depends on what's causing your hair loss, Dr. Michelle Henry, a board-certified dermatologist and Harvard-trained Mohs surgeon who specializes in hair loss, tells Yahoo Life. For cases related to genetic hair loss, two commonly prescribed and FDA-approved treatments are minoxidil and finasteride, she says. These treatments have demonstrated positive results in stimulating hair regrowth, although individual responses may vary. If your hair loss is extreme or you're concerned about the cause, consulting a board-certified dermatologist is recommended. One common cause of temporary hair loss and thinning is illness, including COVID-19, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). While there isn't a specific immediate cure for COVID-induced hair loss, there are several steps you can take to promote regrowth and improve the overall health of your hair post-illness, Dr. Jake Woods, a board-certified dermatologist at Gya Labs, tells Yahoo Life. If you notice hair loss three to four months after a mild to severe bout of Covid or the flu, you can almost bet that is the cause. People can also develop hair loss from underlying medical conditions like alopecia areata, Taub says. And, of course, there's the genetic role our DNA plays in hair loss. The good news is that regardless of the source of your thinning and balding, there is a treatment to help reverse or reduce the shedding. There are a range of products on the market that can help with hair loss and thinning. These include: Serums Shampoos Oils Foams Prescription medications Vitamins and supplements Hair growth products can be costly, so it's important to figure out in advance how much you can comfortably spend. Keep in mind that spending more won't necessarily get you better results. Instead, focus on finding the right treatment plan for your particular type of hair loss, as well as your individual needs. Type: Topical solution Key ingredient: 5% minoxidil Best for: Pattern baldness, all-over regrowth It's been a leader in hair growth products for over 30 years, so it's no surprise that Rogaine tops our list. Its extra-strength 5% minoxidil topical solution is FDA-approved to treat pattern hair loss and has been clinically proven to show results for most people within 12 weeks of regular use. It's also easy to apply and can be used in the shower. As with many hair growth products, the best results with Rogaine come the earlier you address hair shedding. While this particular 5% solution treatment is recommended for men, there is also Rogaine for women with a specially formulated 2% solution. On month two, I could already see results, and month three I am clear that this product works for me, says a happy customer. Type: Spray Key ingredient: 5% minoxidil Best for: Thinning hair Tomum's 5% minoxidil hair growth treatment features the same key ingredient as many popular hair regrowth products at a fraction of the cost. This treatment comes in the form of a spray, so you can target the areas where you need it most. The company says you'll see results in four to eight weeks, but some happy customers say they've seen improvements even sooner.\"}\n",

      "{\"July inflation data shows 'convincing' signs price pressures easing, taking heat off Fed\": \"Inflation reaccelerated in July for the first time in 13 months. But beneath the surface of the 3.2% headline number revealed in Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report are several signs the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation is headed in the right direction. The July CPI report offered more convincing evidence that inflation pressures are abating, EY-Parthenon senior economist Lydia Boussour said on Thursday. Fuel price increases helped force headline inflation back up in July. When looking at core inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge that strips out the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose at their slowest pace since October 2021. Core prices increased 4.7% year-over-year in July, down from 4.8% in June and 5.9% in July 2022. On a monthly basis, core CPI increased 0.2% for the second-straight month, marking the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months.\"}\n",
      "{\"Lil Tay not actually dead: Child rapper and her brother are 'safe and alive' after apparent death hoax\": \"It turns out that Lil Tay, the Canadian internet child rapper, is not actually dead. One day after it was announced on her official Instagram account that she and her brother, 21-year-old Jason Tian, had both died, the provocative performer and social media influencer who found internet fame at age 9 with her foul-mouthed antics and cash flashing before abruptly dropping off social media in 2018, has surfaced to say it was a hoax and that her account was hacked. I want to make it clear that my brother and I are safe and alive, but I’m completely heartbroken and struggling to even find the right words to say, Tay told TMZ on Thursday. It’s been a very traumatizing 24 hours. All day yesterday, I was bombarded with endless heartbreaking and tearful phone calls from loved ones all while trying to sort out this mess. She said her Instagram account was compromised by a 3rd party and it was used to spread jarring misinformation and rumors regarding me, to the point that even my name was wrong. My legal name is Tay Tian, not 'Claire Hope.' She thanked Meta, owner of Instagram, for helping her get back into her account. What happened? The good news comes amid a very strange 24 hours. On Wednesday, the announcement that Tay and her brother, an aspiring rapper, had died appeared on her account, which has 3.3 million followers.\"}\n",
      "{\"Social Security's cost-of-living increase could be only 3%: Will that be enough?\": \"Fed's Daly tells Yahoo Finance there's 'still more work to do' on inflation Seniors brace yourselves. You will likely be getting a 3% Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, next year, well below the 8.7% increase in benefits received this year. That's the new 2024 estimate from The Senior Citizens League (SCL), which translates to an average monthly benefit check hike of less than $54. You can thank cooling inflation for the potentially paltry COLA. This year’s leap, the biggest increase in four decades, raised the average retiree benefit by more than $140 per month. The smaller COLA would sting the more than 70 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who are still grappling with the lingering squeeze from high prices, such as those seen in housing and health care, according to the nonpartisan group. Older consumers, especially those with lower retirement incomes remain vulnerable to some of the higher prices that haven’t gone down, Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League, told Yahoo Finance. The crystal ball COLA estimate is based on inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning that showed consumer prices in July rose 3.2% over the prior year, a slight bump from June's 3% annual increase but far below last year’s soaring inflation. The actual COLA, which the Social Security Administration is expected to announce in mid-October, is calculated by averaging together the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the third quarter of the year — July, August, and September of 2023 — and then comparing that figure with the same data from last year.\"}\n",
      "{\"San Francisco Fed’s Daly: 'There’s still more work to do' on inflation\": \"San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said a new report out Thursday showed inflation is coming down but is still too high, leaving the central bank with more work to do. The CPI data came in largely as expected and that is good news, Daly told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview, referring to a 3.2% rise in the Consumer Price Index in July over the prior year, a slight acceleration from June's 3% annual increase but in line with forecasts. It's also consistent with what we believe will be happening, which is that inflation will gradually make its way down, she added. But it is not a data point that says victory is ours. There's still more work to do.” When looking at core inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge that strips out the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose at their slowest pace since October 2021. Core prices increased 4.7% year over year in July, down from 4.8% in June and 5.9% in July 2022. While trending in the right direction, inflation remains well above the Fed’s 2% target. Daly said she is highly data dependent and is reserving her judgment for how much work is needed to bring down inflation until the Fed’s September policy meeting, when she will pencil in her projections for interest rates.\"}\n",
